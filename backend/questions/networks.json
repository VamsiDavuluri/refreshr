    "question": "In the TCP header, what is the purpose of the 'Window Size' field?",
    "options": [
      "To indicate the protocol version",
      "To specify the number of bytes the receiver is currently willing to accept",
      "To set the packet's time-to-live",
      "To ensure packet ordering"
    ],
    "answer": "To specify the number of bytes the receiver is currently willing to accept",
    "explanation": "The Window Size field is fundamental to TCP's flow control mechanism. It tells the sender how much data it can transmit before receiving an acknowledgment."

    "question": "Which routing protocol uses a link-state algorithm?",
    "options": ["BGP", "RIP", "OSPF", "EIGRP"],
    "answer": "OSPF",
    "explanation": "Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol. Each router constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, and computes the best path to each destination."

    "question": "In the context of the OSI model, at which layer does encryption (like TLS/SSL) primarily occur?",
    "options": [
      "Layer 2 (Data Link)",
      "Layer 4 (Transport)",
      "Layer 6 (Presentation)",
      "Layer 7 (Application)"
    ],
    "answer": "Layer 6 (Presentation)",
    "explanation": "The Presentation Layer is responsible for data translation, compression, and encryption/decryption. While TLS operates as a 'shim' between Transport and Application, its functions align with the Presentation Layer's responsibilities."

      "A security vulnerability in firewalls"
    ],
    "answer": "The difficulty for two devices behind different NATs to communicate directly",
    "explanation": "Network Address Translation (NAT) hides private IP addresses. NAT traversal techniques (like STUN/TURN) are needed to establish peer-to-peer connections when both peers are behind NAT devices."

    ],
    "answer": "A Layer 3 (IP) address to a Layer 2 (MAC) address",
    "explanation": "When a device needs to send a packet to another device on the same local network, it uses ARP to find the destination's hardware (MAC) address from its known IP address."

    "answer": "TCP is connection-oriented, while UDP is connectionless",
    "explanation": "TCP establishes a reliable connection, guaranteeing packet delivery, ordering, and error-checking. UDP is a 'fire-and-forget' protocol that offers speed at the expense of guaranteed delivery."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'subnet mask' used for?",

  {
    "question": "What does 'Quality of Service' (QoS) refer to in networking?",
    "options": [
      "The speed of the internet connection",

    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a 'worm'?",
    "options": [
      "It requires a host program to spread",
      "It is a self-replicating program that spreads across networks",

      "It can only be spread via email"
    ],
    "answer": "It is a self-replicating program that spreads across networks",
    "explanation": "Unlike a virus, which attaches itself to an existing program, a worm is a standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers, often exploiting network vulnerabilities."

  {
    "question": "The 'time-to-live' (TTL) field in an IP header is used to:",
    "options": [
      "Synchronize clocks between routers",
      "Measure the round-trip time of a packet",
      "Prevent packets from circulating indefinitely in a network",
      "Indicate the priority of the packet"
    ],
    "answer": "Prevent packets from circulating indefinitely in a network",
    "explanation": "TTL is an 8-bit field. Each router that forwards the packet decrements the TTL value by one. If the TTL value reaches zero, the packet is discarded, preventing it from getting stuck in routing loops forever."

  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a VLAN?",
    "options": [
      "To increase the physical speed of a LAN",
      "To segment a physical network into multiple logical networks",

      "To connect two different networks together"
    ],
    "answer": "To segment a physical network into multiple logical networks",
    "explanation": "A Virtual LAN (VLAN) allows a network administrator to partition a single switched network, creating multiple distinct broadcast domains. This improves security and network management."

      "To store a backup of the private key"
    ],
    "answer": "To issue digital certificates and vouch for the identity of a website",
    "explanation": "A Certificate Authority is a trusted third party that signs and issues digital certificates. Browsers trust these CAs, and therefore trust the certificates they issue, which is fundamental to securing HTTPS connections."

      "Resolving domain names",
      "Assigning IP addresses automatically",
      "Routing traffic between networks",
      "Encrypting web traffic"
    ],
    "answer": "Assigning IP addresses automatically",
    "explanation": "DHCP automates the process of assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers to devices on a network, simplifying network administration."

  {
    "question": "What are the three steps of the TCP three-way handshake, in order?",
    "options": [
      "SYN -> ACK -> SYN-ACK",
      "FIN -> ACK -> FIN-ACK",
      "SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK",
      "ACK -> SYN -> ACK"
    ],
    "answer": "SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK",
    "explanation": "The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet, the server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet, and the client completes the connection by sending an ACK (acknowledgment) packet."
